# Credit Risk Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing credit risk using machine learning models, specifically logistic regression. The dataset used contains information about loans, including their status (healthy or high-risk). The goal is to build and evaluate a logistic regression model for predicting credit risk and assessing its performance.

## Data

The primary dataset, `lending_data.csv`, includes information on loans, with the target variable being the loan status (0 for healthy, 1 for high-risk). The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Logistic Regression Model with Original Data

- The logistic regression model is trained using the original data.
- Model performance metrics:
  - Balanced accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
- Summary of results and analysis included in the notebook.

## Logistic Regression Model with Random Oversampling

- The logistic regression model is trained using oversampled data to address class imbalance.
- Model performance metrics:
  - Balanced accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
- Comparison of results with the original model in the notebook.
